# Nested Todos POC

Super simple svelte POC to show my desired task nesting in a todo app. I have not found this in a polished solution, but I personally think of tasks in a hierarchical way that is not well represented in the apps that I've tried.

Ideally, a parent task being marked as done will complete all subtasks. Any child tasks that are un-checked, all parent todos should also be marked as incomplete, as all of the dependencies are no longer being met.
